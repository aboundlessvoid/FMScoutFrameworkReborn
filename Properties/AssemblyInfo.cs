// Assembly attributes were previously defined here for older project format.
// In SDK-style projects the compiler may generate these attributes automatically.
// To avoid duplicate attribute errors the explicit attributes were removed.
// If you need to keep custom assembly attributes, re-add them here selectively.
//
// Example (uncomment to restore a single attribute):
// [assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyTitle("FMScoutFramework Reborn")]
